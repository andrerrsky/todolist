- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Learn more about Next.js

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/);

## Recommended

`Visual Studio Code` IDE, [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), [Stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint), [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) are recommended.

## Unit Tests

We use Jest and RTL for unit tests, the coverage limit for commits is 100%. See more about Jest [here](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/) and RTL [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

The coverage report can be viewed in the coverage/lcov-report/index.html file after running the test command:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

## Icons

We use styled-icons library on the project. It includes popular icon sets that you can browse at [styled-icons.dev](https://styled-icons.dev/).

## Plop

We use the Plop library to generate components according to the structure defined for this project. See more about Plop [here](https://plopjs.com/).

You can create a component manually, but I recommend using the command below and following the instructions in the console:

```bash
npm run generate
# or
yarn generate
```

## Husky

Husky is used to run lint and unit tests in the commit and pre-push events of git, if an error occurs in these procedures the commit/push cannot be performed until the problem is corrected. Learn more about Husky [here](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

## Commits

[Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) checks if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format in this project.

In general the pattern mostly looks like this:
`type(scope?): subject`

Real world examples can look like this:

`chore: run tests on travis ci`
`fix(server): send cors headers`
`feat(blog): add comment section`

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) can be:

- build
- chore
- ci
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test
